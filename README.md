# DatabaseWeek8Assignment


## Question 1: Build a Complete Database Management System

**Objective:**

The objective of this work is to design and implement a full-featured database using only MySQL.

For that I have chosen to create a database which reflect my experience of learning the database module as a PLP scholarchip's recipient or learner. 

That database will be entitled **"PLP_Scholarship_Academy_Database".**

## Structure of the database

The "PLP_Scholarship_Academy_Database"
 has three tables:
  "*"students"*" table
 "*"modules"*" table concerning the modules to be learned
 "*"enrollement "*"table.

 A [drawing](C:\Users\HP\Desktop\week8DatabaseAssignemnt\DatabaseWeek8Assignment\plp_scholarship_academy_database_relationships.png) or schema  showcasing the relationships that exist between these tables is also inculded.

Design your database schema in MySQL (at least 2â€“3 tables)

Build an API using:

Node.js + Express (if using JavaScript)

FastAPI (if using Python)
